This course will discuss broad topics in Network Security. 
    Topics for Fall 2025 is centered around Internet Security Protocols and the 
    effect of evolving architectures on such protocols.
    
Cryptographic Network Security Protocols can be broadly classified into data-plane protocols (like TLS, QUIC, IPSec, WireGuard, 802.1x etc.) and control-plane protocols like DNSSec and BGPSec. However,  irrespective of the plane any security protocol can be seen as consisting of 2 fundamental components - "Source of Truth" Functions FS(), and "Verification Functions" FV(). The former is typically independent of the specific protocol. The latter (FV()) is protocol dependent. 

Source-of-truth functions serve to establish the origin of a message - which can be a control message or a data packet. Such functions typically rest on some hierarchical structure. 

Once the source of truth has been established, protocol dependent verification functions determine if the data/control message satisfies some prerequisite properties (which are highly protocol specific). 

The goals of this course are 2-fold:
<ol>
<li> To develop a unified perspective of the 2 fundamental components in various data-plane 
    and control-plane Network Security protocols, understand the components / parties involved 
    in executing functions  FS() and FV(), and practical operational requirements to ensure that 
    the components perform as intended
<li> Keeping up with advances in Network infrastructure, how changes to infrastructure can aid or hinder  the problem of securing networks.
</ol>
The course will begin with a review of Symmetric and Asymmetric Cryptography. This will be followed by introductory lectures to set the stage for student presentations to follow. The first few  presentations will center around QUIC and WireGuard, and comparisons with the protocols that they aim to replace, viz., TLS and IPSec (respectively).  

This will be followed by discussions and student presentations  on various topics that can include (for example)
<ol>
<li>evolving architectural models for the Internet,
<li>changing dynamics of Internet traffic (and, consequently, congestion control),
<li>evolving paradigms in bandwidth-latency tradeoffs, 
<li>implications of Net Neutrality.
<li> implications of generative AI
  </ol>

All discussions should ultimately strive to address the question of security challenges / benefits.

    <h2>Schedule (Tentative) </h2> 

<ol>
    <li> Aug 21,26: Intro to Cryptography and Networks

<li> Aug 28,Sep 2: Source of Truth and Verification function Examples

<li> Sep 4,9: Evolving Internet Architectures

<li> Sep 11 - Oct 2: Student Presentations (First Round - Likely to change depending on the number of Students)

<li> Oct 7 - Oct 16: Group Discussions on Presentations

<li> Oct 21- Nov 20 - Student Presentations (Second Round)

<li> Nov 20 - Dec 2 : Group discussions
    </ol>

    <h2> Grading </h2> 

Grading will be based on presentation (30%), participation (20%) in discussions and assignments (50%).  Assignments will include literature survey, programming assignments , and short reports.

<OL>
	<LI><P>Add/drop without penalty</P>
	<P>A student has through the fifth class day into the semester to
	add a course and through the tenth class day to drop a course
	without being assessed a fee or academic penalty.</P>
	<LI><P>Drop after the tenth class day through the 30th class day
	into the semester</P>
	<P>A student who elects to drop a course during this period must
	receive the approval of his/her adviser, will be assigned a W on
	his/her academic record, and be assessed a fee. The adviser who
	permits the drop will specify its effective date.</P>
	<LI><P>Drop after the 30th class day into the semester</P>
	<P>A student cannot drop courses after this period except in
	documented cases of serious illness, extreme hardship, or failure of
	the instructor to provide significant assessment of his/her
	performance. A request to drop a course during this period must be
	approved by the student's adviser and academic dean. The dean who
	permits the drop will specify its effective date. A student
	receiving permission to drop will receive a W on his/her academic
	record and be assessed a fee.</P>
	<LI><P>Faculty are expected to provide a student with significant
	evidence or assessment of his/her class performance within the first
	six weeks.</P>
        <LI> <P> Disability Resource Center </P>
<P> Mississippi State University is committed to providing equitable access to learning opportunities for all students. The Disability Resource Center (01 Montgomery Hall) collaborates with students who have disabilities to arrange reasonable accommodations. If you have, or think you may have, a disability, please contact drc@saffairs.msstate.edu or 662-325-3335 to arrange a confidential discussion regarding equitable access and reasonable accommodations. Disabilities may include, but are not limited to, conditions related to mental health, chronic health, attention, learning, autism, brain injury, vision, hearing, mobility, speech, or intellectual disabilities. In the case of short-term disabilities (e.g., broken arm), students and instructors can often work to minimize barriers. If additional assistance is needed, please contact the Disability Resource Center. 
</P>
<LI> <P> Continuity of Instruction</P>
<P> In the event that face-to-face classes are suspended due to extenuating circumstances, such as weather, the instructor will continue instruction in a manner that best supports the course content and student engagement. In this event, all instructors will notify students of the change via their university email address (the official vehicle for communication with students). At that time, they will provide details about how instruction and communication will continue, how academic integrity will be ensured, and what students may expect during the time that face-to-face classes are suspended. If a student becomes unable to continue class participation due to extenuating circumstances, (e.g., health and safety, loss of power, etc.)  the student should contact their instructor and advisor for guidance. For additional guidance, please refer to Academic Operating Policy 12.09.
</P>
<LI><P> Attendance policy for face-to-face instruction </P>
<P>This section is a face-to-face instructional class. Please refer to  Academic Operating Policy 12.09, regarding attendance expectations and accommodations.
